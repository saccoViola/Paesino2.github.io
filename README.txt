In this little town we have a shepherd and a knitter interacting with each other to buy and sell their products. 
Unfortunally at the moment the knitter can only buy from the shepherd and he doesn't have someone to sell his stuff yet. 
Maybe in the future he will! 

The graphics need to be fixed, I was focusing more on the dynamicity and in working with objects
